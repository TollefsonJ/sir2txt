RE: Short-Term Response Action Completion Addendum
509 Metacom Avenue
Bristol, RI
RIDEM Case # 2013-013

Dear Ms. Blauvelt:

Alliance Environmental Group, Inc. (AEG) is providing the following addendum report
following receipt of a RIDEM comment letter dated May 2, 2013.

RIDEM Comments:

#1 The closure states the first set set of confirmatory samples contained arsenic
exceeding the Department’s Direct Exposure Criteria and, as a result, “AEG ordered
additional soil removal.” Please provide more detail on the additional soil removal. The
material disposal logs indicate that 96 additional cubic yards of material were taken off-
site on April 12, 2013. Was the excavation area widened or deepened, and, if so, by how
much?

Because the soil to be removed was a deposited pile, the initial day of the excavation
was completed to its approximate base. On that day, AEG arrived toward the tail end of
the work day to gauge the excavation status and also if appropriate collect
representative base and sidewall samples (200 series) for laboratory analysis on a 24-
hour turnaround in order to prevent removal of additional soils which may not have
been impacted.

At the time of the initial sampling (April 11°), AEG noted the removal effort at the

center of the pile (base sample) was deeper than the perimeter and as a result we
would collect the needed samples but informed the client that the remaining pile edges

ew |

509 Metacom Avenue, Bristol, RI (RIDEM Case #2013-13) May 2013
would need to be removed to at least the base elevation. As such the client continued
removal efforts during April 12" and once receiving the initial sampling results and as
expected the perimeter samples from the soil pile continued to contain arsenic in excess
of the DEC, however, the base was compliant. As a result it was confirmed the necessity
for the additional soils removed during the April 12" effort. At the conclusion of the
work and in order to confirm the pile was removed, AEG returned to the Site on
Saturday, April 13, 2013, to collect additional soil samples from the perimeter of the soil
pile area. Upon arrival, it was confirmed the additional soil removal conducted over
April 12"" removed the perimeter of soil pile soils to the elevation of the April 11" base
sample. In total four (4) sidewall samples (300 series) were collected and analyzed for
arsenic, which were all compliant. All sample results are attached hereto as Appendix A.

Asa result, the excavation area was not actually deepened or widened. On April 12"
required soils within the pile were removed.

#2 Figure 2 shows the second set of confirmatory samples taken on April 13, 2013,
were taken in the exact same location as the first set of samples taken on April 11, 2013.
If the samples were in fact taken at the same location, at what depth was the second set
of samples taken? If the first and second round confirmatory samples were not taken at
the exact same location, please amend the site figure to reflect this.

As noted above and during this response action, the efforts undertaken were to remove
a surface grade deposited soil. During the initial day of the removal activity (April 11")
AEG arrived toward the end of the day to gauge the progress and also collect sample to
determine if response actions were achieved in order to avoid removal of additional soil.
The initial inspection showed the base area of the pile was excavated to apparent native
surrounding grade, however the sides of the pile remained above the base elevation.
AEG still collected samples to determine arsenic content, but instructed the contractor
to continue removal actions on April 12'" to at least reach the apparent native
surrounding grade. These actions were completed during April 12" and AEG returned
April 13" to collect additional samples from the pile extents because the base (as
expected) passed. The second round of sidewall samples (300 series) were collected
approximately within the same location of the initial (200 series), except at a deeper
depth (depth depth with the base and surrounding grade).

#3 The scale provided on Figure 2 indicates that the excavation sidewalls were
approximately 45 feet while the report narrative states that each sidewall of was less
than 25 feet long. Please confirm the actual length of each sidewall and amend Figure 2
to more accurately depict the extents of the excavation. Confirm that the appropriate
number of confirmatory samples have been taken to demonstrate compliance with the
Dig & Haul Policy or, take additional confirmatory samples to achieve compliance.

All field confirmatory soil sampling was collected in accordance with the policy and field
measurements showed no sidewall was greater than 25’. After receiving this comment,
AEG reviewed the scaling parameters of the plan and did find an error in the reported

Al lance

scale. After review, the scale shown upon the plan should have been 1” = ~ 30’ which
would explain the initial discrepancy. As such, the plan has been amended to reflect the
correct scale and is attached hereto.

#4 The Closure Report contains one Table, which only presents the sampling results
for the second round of confirmatory sampling. Please include all sampling results in the
tabular format in the Closure Report Addendum.
