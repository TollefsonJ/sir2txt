RE: Release Notification
509 Metacom Avenue, Bristol, RI
Providence Assessors Plat 108, Lot 7

Dear Ms. Owens:

On behalf of our client, Domenico Bucci and Irma Santilli, owner of the above-referenced location
(hereinafter, “Site”), Alliance Environmental Group, Inc. (AEG) has completed the following Release
Notification in accordance with Section 5 of the RIDEM Remediation Regulations, as amended November
2011. A United States Geological Survey (USGS) Locus map depicting the Site location has been attached.

During testing of the Site AEG identified a foreign soil pile which was placed there at an unknown time
and from an unknown source. Testing of pile for Priority Pollutant 13 (PP13) metals, total petroleum
hydrocarbon (TPH), poly-nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and field screening for volatile organics
using a photo-ionization detector (PID) showed arsenic to be the only detected analyte in excess of the
RIDEM Direct Exposure Criteria (R-DEC). Subsequent testing of the pile for arsenic confirmed the
consistency of its presence. Based upon the Site conditions, AEG is preparing to abate the soil via removal
and disposal at a licensed facility using the “Dig and Haul” Policy.

Attached hereto, please find a completed and executed RIDEM Release Notification Form in addition to
associated appendices.

If you have any questions or concerns please contact the undersigned at 401-732-7600.

Very truly yours,
Alliance Environmental Group, Inc.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Sample Receipt

The samples were all appropriately cooled and preserved upon receipt. The samples were
received in the appropriate containers. The chain of custody was adequately completed
and corresponded to the samples submitted.

Metals

All analyses were performed according to NETLAB’s documented Standard Operating
Procedures, within all required holding times, and with appropriate quality control
measures. All QC was within laboratory established acceptance criteria. The samples
were received, processed, and reported with no anomalies.

PAHs

All samples were extracted and analyzed within method specified holding times and
according to NETLAB’s documented standard operating procedures. The results for the
associated calibration, method blank and laboratory control sample (LCS) were within
method specified quality control criteria.

Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons

All samples were extracted and analyzed within method specified holding times and
according to NETLAB’s documented standard operating procedures. The results for the
associated calibration, method blank and laboratory control sample (LCS) were within
method specified quality control criteria.

Due to matrix interference, the surrogate was reported outside of QC limits.
