(AEG) is providing this letter to suffice completion of a Short-Term Response Action on behalf of Mr. Domenico Bucci and Ms. Irma Santilli, owner of the above-referenced property (hereinafter, “Site”). a. Anarrative summary of the completed excavation activities The Site was found to have a pile of approximately 150 yards of soil of unknown origin. The pile was tested and found to contain arsenic in excess of the RIDEM Direct Exposure Criteria (DEC). As a result, the detections were reported to RIDEM in the form of a Release Notification, and the subject Case # 2013-013 was assigned. Due to these findings, the response action selected was to remove the soil pile for disposal at a licensed facility in accordance with the RIDEM, “Dig and Haul Policy” (“Policy”). As such, on April 11 and 12, 2013, the subject pile was excavated and transported to the Portsmouth Landfill, located along Park Avenue in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, in accordance with their existing Beneficial Use Determination (BUD) Permit. Much of the soil pile was removed on April 11"; andasa result, AEG returned to the Site to collect samples in accordance with the Policy, which included four (4) sidewall samples and one (1) base sample due to the size of the pile (i.e., no sidewall >25 feet and no deeper than 5 feet) . Each sample was submitted to a Rhode Island certified laboratory for analysis of total arsenic. This round of sampling determined that perimeter samples still AllianceEGI.com A Short-Term Response Action Completion AEG Project #f 2198 509 Metacom Avenue, Bristol, RI (RIDEM Case #2013-13) April 2013 contained arsenic at levels in excess of the RIDEM DEC; however, the central base sample was found to be in compliance. Asa result, on April 12" AEG ordered additional soil removal. Once the additional soils were removed, AEG again returned to the Site on April 13" to collect an additional four (4) perimeter soil samples for analysis. These additional samples were also analyzed for total arsenic and found to be in compliance with the RIDEM DEC. Below is a table which summarizes the results of the final confirmatory soil samples.
