If the first and second round confirmatory samples were not taken at the exact same location, please amend the site figure to reflect this. 3. The scale provided on Figure 2 indicates that the excavation sidewalls were approximately 45 feet while the report narrative states that each sidewall of was less than 25 feet long.
