1.0 65 Centerville Road (Plat 246 / Lot 218) and 1363 Greenwich Avenue (Plat 246 / Lot 298) Warwick, Rhode Island July 6, 2007 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ATC Lincoln Associates (ATC Lincoln) was retained by Gordon R. Archibald, Inc. to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the property identified by the City of Warwick Assessor’s Office as Lot 218 and 298 on Map 246 located at 65 Centerville Road and 1363 Greenwich Avenue in Warwick, Rhode Island (the site). ATC Lincoln’s findings are summarized below: The site is identified by the Warwick Tax Assessor’s Office as Lot 218 and 298 on Plat Map 246. Lot 218 totals approximately 21.274 acres of land. Lot 298 totals approximately 1.81 acres of land. The site currently contains the following five buildings: People’s Storage Warehouse (Building #1), Sawtooth Building (Building #2), Jet-Dock (Building #3), Rig- Rite (Building #4), and a Garage. According to the Sanborn Maps, the site was formerly identified as the Apponaug Co. Dyeing Bleaching & Print Works and the Aspinook Corporation, Apponaug Division, Dyeing, Bleaching, and Print Works from at least 1911 until 1958. Both of these businesses were engaged in textile manufacturing. Tenants of the site buildings since the 1960’s included a metal stamping and dye company, a seat cover manufacturer, a rug cleaner, and other commercial businesses. One 3,000-gallon fuel oil aboveground storage tank was observed on the southern portion of the first floor of the People’s Storage Warehouse (Building #1). This tank was enclosed by an eight-foot high concrete block secondary containment structure. One 275-gallon fuel oil aboveground storage tank was observed in the office area of the People’s Storage Warehouse (Building #1). One 275-gallon aboveground storage tank was observed in Section 1 & 2 of Rig Rite (Building #4). The contents of this tank are not known. Two buildings on the 65 Centerville Road property were connected to the municipal sewer on November 7, 1995. According to the Warwick Department of Public Works Sewer Department, the 1363 Greenwich Avenue address is not connected to municipal sewer. Numerous floor drains were observed in the interior portions of the site buildings. The discharge point of these drains is not known. Three fires occurred at the site in February 1961, November 1966, September 1969, and February 2005. There are two Spills on file at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) for the site. The site was also identified on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information Systems (CERCLIS), NFRAP, Underground Storage Tank (UST), and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) databases. 65 Centerville Road (Plat 246 / Lot 218) and 1363 Greenwich Avenue (Plat 246 / Lot 298) Warwick, Rhode Island July 6, 2007 According to Fire Department records, on June 23, 1986, a chemical spill occurred at the 1363 Greenwich Avenue site address. RIDEM responded to the spill. Styrene monomer, acetone, and polystyrene resin were removed as part of the response. The memo stated that Fiber Glass Manufacturing, Co. was responsible for the spill. Fire Department records indicate that a 2,250-gallon gasoline UST was removed from the 65 Centerville Road site in 1950 and a 2,000-gallon UST was removed from the 1363 Greenwich Avenue site in 1960. The location and condition of these tanks upon removal are not known. RIDEM had no records regarding these tanks. In September 1989, a 250,000-gallon No. 2 fuel oil UST was cleaned, and capped with cement. The tank was not filled due to its size. A closure assessment was not available in the RIDEM files. In November 1989, one 2,000-gallon gasoline UST was removed from the site. The Certificate of Closure issued by RIDEM contained a note stating that the tank had a “precision test failure” and that the leak was likely in the piping. The condition of the tank upon removal is not known. A closure assessment was not available in the RIDEM files. Three properties within a 0.50-mile radius of the site were identified on the STATE database. Eleven properties within a 0.50-mile radius of the site were identified on the leaking underground storage tank (LUST) database. Three abutting properties were identified on the UST database. Based on a review of area topography and the location of these properties from the site, environmental conditions at these properties are not likely to adversely impact the site. According to a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment completed by Applied Enviro-Tech, Inc., on May 2004, for the site located at 65 Centerville Road, a former fuel oil UST was converted for use as a septic tank. The condition of this tank prior to its conversion is not known. This assessment has revealed evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the site.
